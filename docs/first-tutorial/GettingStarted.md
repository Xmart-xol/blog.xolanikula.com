## Prerequisites
Before starting with C# development, make sure you have the following:

- A Windows-based computer.
- An internet connection to download the required software.
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.

## Installing Visual Studio
Visual Studio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for C# programming. Follow these steps to install Visual Studio:

1. Go to the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and download the installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Select the **C# workload** during the installation process.
4. Choose any additional components or settings according to your preference.
5. Wait for the installation to complete.

## Creating a New Project
Once you have installed Visual Studio, you can create a new C# project:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click on **Create a new project** on the start page.
3. Select **Console App (.NET Core)** template under **C#** category.
4. Choose a suitable project name and location.
5. Click on **Create**.

## Writing Your First C# Program
Now that you have created a new project, it's time to write your first C# program:

1. Open the **Program.cs** file from the solution explorer.
2. Replace the existing code with the following:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```
Save the file.
Running the Program
To run your C# program in Visual Studio, follow these steps:

Press Ctrl + F5 or click on the Start button in the toolbar.
You should see the output "Hello, World!" in the console window.
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up the development environment for C# programming and written your first C# program. In the next sections, we will dive deeper into the language and explore more C# concepts.
